    // 2. The Global Queue
//    This Queue is separated into 4 main types and a default type according to QOS(Quality of Service), from highest priority to lowest:
//    1- userInteractive : Work is virtually instantaneous. Similar to main thread.
//    2- userInitiated : Work is nearly instantaneous, such as a few seconds or less.
//    3- default: donâ€™t use it usually , the type will be inferred by the system
//    4- utility: Work takes a few seconds to a few minutes.
//    5- background: Work takes significant time, such as minutes or hours.

        DispatchQueue.global(qos: type).async {
            // do your heavy opperations here
        }
    }
    
    // 3. Custom Queues
//    A good choice when you want to perform background work serially and track it. This eliminates resource contention and race conditions since you know only one task at a time is executing. Note that if you need the data from a method, you must declare another closure to retrieve it or consider using sync
